# Detection-of-Fraudulent-Transactions
Banking and financial institutions are facing severe challenges due to fraudulent transactions. 2015 alone saw a $21.84 billion fraud losses on on credit, debit and prepaid cards. An article published in Forbes predicts that this could grow by 45% by 2020. Traditional approach of using rules and authenticating transactions is no longer a viable method due to the plethora of payment channels and adept criminals. Machine learning enables to detect and recognize patterns on customer’s purchase history efficiently even on larger datasets. Using machine learning for fraud detection is no longer a trend, it’s a necessity.

In this project, we will be looking at implementing a logistic regression model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
